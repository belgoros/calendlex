# Calendlex

This is a web application built when following the [series of articles](https://bigardone.dev/blog/2021/11/06/building-a-simple-calendly-clone-with-phoenix-live-view-pt-1) to build a clone of Calendly scheduling service application using Phoenix Framework.

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
